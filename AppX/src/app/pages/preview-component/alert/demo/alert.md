## Alert
 
Alerts are a great way to offer the user the ability to choose a specific action or list of actions. Alerts can include contain text, inputs and buttons. They can provide the user with important information, or require them to make a decision (or multiple decisions). Alerts should only be used for quick actions like password verification, small app notifications, or quick options.
