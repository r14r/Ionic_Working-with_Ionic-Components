## Button

Buttons are an essential way to interact with and navigate through an app, and should clearly communicate what action will occur after the user taps them. Buttons are highly customizeable with color, shape and size being fully customizeable. We support round buttons, FAB buttons, outline buttons and more!

```html
<ion-button shape="round" color="primary" fill="outline">Hello World</ion-button>
<ion-button size="small">Small Button</ion-button>
```
