## List

The list component is used to display rows of information, such as a contact list, playlist, or menu. It can display cards, list items and more. Lists are also very customizeable and match the design of the native Android and iOS lists by default.

```html
<ion-list>
  <ion-item>
    <ion-avatar slot="start">
      <img src="/docs/assets/img/avatar-finn.png"></img>
    </ion-avatar>
    <ion-label>
      <h2>Finn</h2>
      <h3>I'm a big deal</h3>
      <p>Listen, I've had a pretty messed up day...</p>
    </ion-label>
  </ion-item>
</ion-list>
```
