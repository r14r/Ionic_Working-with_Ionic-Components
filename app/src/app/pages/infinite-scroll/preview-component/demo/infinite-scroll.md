## Infinite Scroll

An infinite scroll allows you to perform an action when the user scrolls a specified distance from the bottom or top of the page, such as loading more data in a long list of paginated data. It is also very customizeable with different loading indicators supported.


```html
<ion-infinite-scroll>
  <ion-infinite-scroll-content
    loadingSpinner="bubbles"
    loadingText="Loading more data...">
  </ion-infinite-scroll-content>
</ion-infinite-scroll>
```
