## Nav

Navigation is how users move between different pages in your app. Ionicâ€™s navigation follows standard navigation concepts and animated transitions. Ionic's nav can also adapt to larger viewports using [ion-split-pane](/docs/api/split-pane)

```html
<ion-app>
  <ion-nav root="page-one"></ion-nav>
</ion-app>
```
